## Critical Reflection
This 3D model of the classic board game Snakes and Ladders was heavily inspired by the Wizard Chess Board in Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone. Using this as inspiration created a dungeon like environment where the model of the board game is a larger scale that humans can stand on each of the board’s tiles. The board itself is made from stone, marble and a wooden stand. The numbers on the tiles are presented as roman numerals to suit the aesthetic of the model. The snakes on the board are designed to represent the real-life reptile and the wooden ladders are designed to be life-sized. The board itself is surrounded by fire goblets while the room has four lanterns that light the entire room scene. The board’s playable objects are two meeples that resemble pawns, one white and one black. The dice are modelled from a classic style that are kept in a wooden and metal chest.

Being new to 3D Modelling this assignment was quite challenging in terms of the time dedicated and skill required to construct the entire model. One main part of the model that I do think needs improvement are the snakes. For me I found it hard to accurately model them. The snake models went through 3 different styles with each one better than the last. The final version is currently the best I can do right now with my modelling skill level. Having said that I do believe they turned out quite well and thanks the textures used for the snakes made them even more realistic. Another main part I feel that could be better is the fire in the goblets. Being a 3D Model, it would have been good to simulate actual fires in the goblets but with this assignment requiring an animation it would have taken a lot of time to render the fire’s activity. This resulted in creating static fires from spheres with a flame texture to resemble the fires. This lacks in realism but still creates the looks of the fires.

Being an almost static model, it was hard to plan an animation other than a quick playthrough of the game itself. However, this was a great chance to learn more about camera angles as the animation required multiple angles to capture all the required shots of the objects moving throughout the animation sequence. This also led to learning quite a bit about post processing as it was required to edit several clips together to create the entire video.

Overall, I do feel the dungeon-esque style of the model looks quite well, especially with the roman numerals on the board’s tiles. Modelling this assignment has improved my skills and it was a great experience to be able to design my own style of a classic board game. Although some aspects could be better, I am pleased with the final production.
